# Enterprise MLOps Blueprint

A reusable MLOps architecture for turning analytical models into governed production services.

## Business problem

Model promotion demo that evaluates accuracy, drift, approval, and release readiness.

## Why it matters

Senior AI portfolios need to show more than framework familiarity. This repository demonstrates how business value, architecture thinking, measurable controls, and reproducible demos come together in an enterprise AI asset.

## Solution overview

Model promotion demo that evaluates accuracy, drift, approval, and release readiness.

## Demo

Run the included demo from the repository root:

`ash
python demo/run_demo.py
`

The demo uses sample data in data/ and deterministic Python logic in src/mlops_blueprint/main.py, so it is easy to review without cloud credentials or paid APIs.

## Architecture

See docs/architecture.md for the reference architecture and operating model. See docs/demo.md for the demo walkthrough.

## Quick start

`ash
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
python demo/run_demo.py
`

## Roadmap

- Add a richer UI or dashboard layer
- Add architecture diagrams and deployment examples
- Add more realistic enterprise data samples
- Extend tests into quality, policy, and regression gates

## Enterprise relevance

This repo is designed as a public, reviewable artifact for senior AI leadership conversations: the business case is clear, the architecture is documented, the demo is runnable, and the controls are explicit.
